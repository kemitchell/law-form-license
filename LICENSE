The contributors to this form grant you a license do everything that
would otherwise violate their exclusive rights as copyright holders,
under these conditions:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1.  As far as the law allows, you may not sue any contributor to    |
|     this form for any legal damages or other legal remedies related |
|     to this license or the form.                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

  2.  If the form identifies itself by a distinctive name, and you
      make any changes to the form, other than filling in blanks,
      that might affect its meaning or interpretation, you must also
      change it to make clear to readers that your version is not
      the form by that name, but derived from it.

  3.  If you submit revisions to the form to contributors for
      distribution in a new version, you grant a license for your
      revisions on these terms, as well as a license to the original
      author of the form to relicense under different terms of
      their choice.  The original author may assign their license to
      another contributor, who may assign in turn, and so on.

  4.  You may not use the name of any contributor to this form, or any
      organization with which they are affiliated, to promote anything.

This license (c) Kyle E. Mitchell.  I grant you a license to copy
